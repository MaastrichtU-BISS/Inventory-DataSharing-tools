# Inventory Data Sharing Tools

This repository contains an inventory of privacy-preserving machine learning platforms, algorithms and projects using these algorithms. We are aware this list is not exhaustive, but we aim to keep it up-to-date. Hence, if there are platforms we are missing, please notify us by creating an [issue](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-BISS/Inventory-DataSharing-tools/issues).

## Repository contents
The human-readable listing is available in [inventory.md](./inventory.md). The main data of this inventory is listed in the [data](./data) folder.
